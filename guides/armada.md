# EF Johnson Armada

If a feature is not marked, leave it as the default.

## Systems

### General Options

On this tab, configure [basic system parameters](../README.md#general-system-info) like the **system ID**, **connect tone**, **channel bandwidth**, **conversation type**, and [**radio/subscriber ID**](../README.md#unit--radio--subscriber-id).

The HamTrunk™ is a standalone single-site system, so it operates in site trunking. Turn off this indicator so the radio does not constantly remind you of this fact.

### General Options 2

Although the HamTrunk™ hopes to provide excellent coverage, it is useful to know when a radio is going **out of range** of the system.
